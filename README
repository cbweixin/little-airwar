little airwar is a pure javascript airwar game. I wrote it just for fun. 
Right now, the game is still very simple, I just wrote stage 1, and the difficulty level can not be changed. I plan to enhance this feature in near future( wish my work allows me to do that ). 

 Operations : 
 w - foward
 s - backward
 a - left
 d - right
 j - fire
 k - bomb

 Browser Support :
 Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE9. Sorry for IE8 and Opera.
